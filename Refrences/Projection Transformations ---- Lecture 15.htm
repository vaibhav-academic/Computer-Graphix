<H1>Projection Transformations</H1></CENTER>After the viewing transformation we 
have everything oriented as we would like them to appear in the final image. All 
that remains is to project out the depth, or z-dimension, so that the the 
three-dimensional view-space primitives are reduced to two-dimensional 
screen-space primitives. 
<P>There are many different types of projection. The simplist, is to simply 
ignore the z-dimension. This form of projection is called <B>orthographic</B> or 
<B>parallel</B>. It is the common form of projection used by draftspeople for 
top, bottom, and side views. The advantage of parallel projection is that the 
you can make accurate measurments of image features in the two dimensions that 
remain. The disadvantage is that the images don't appear natural (i.e. they lack 
perspective foreshorting). 
<P>Here is an example of an parallel projection of our scene.

<P>The projection matrix for orthographic projection is very simple

<P>There are someproblems with this simple form, however. To begin with the 
units of the transformed points are still the same as the model. This is great 
for drafting, but in our case we'd like for the units to be in pixels. 
<P>We can incorporate this change of units, and perform the flip of the y-axis 
required for raster coordinates into our projection matrix as follows.

<P>For realistic three-dimensional viewing we'd like for our objects to be 
displayed with proper perspective. Perspective causes objects nearer to the 
viewing poisition to appear larger that the same object would when place farther 
from the viewpoint. 
<P>Artists (Donatello, Brunelleschi, and Da Vinci) during the renaissance 
discovered the importance of perspective for making images appear realistic. 
This outdates mathematicians by more than 300 years. The real reason for 
introducing homogenous, or projective coordinates to computer graphics was to 
accomplish perspective projections using linear operators. Not, as mentioned 
earlier, for comnbining rotations and translations in the same framework. 
<P>Lets start by looking at a perspective projection.

<P>Note how lines known to be parallel in image space appear to converge to 
intersect when viewed in perspective. 
<CENTER><IMG height=300

they always intersect at a point. The projection matrix for perspective 
projection matrix is:

<P>Notice how similar this transform is to the original parallel projection. It 
also has all of the disadvantages of the parallel form, its units are not screen 
space units. The following transformation accomplishs the projection and the 
conversion to pixels in a single transform.

<P>For the purpose of clipping we can modify this transformation so that it is 
mapped into a canonical space. Following is a canonical space mapping for 
orthographic projections.

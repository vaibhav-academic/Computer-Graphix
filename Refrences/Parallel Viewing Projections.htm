<H1 align=center>Parallel Viewing Projections</H1>
<P>Projection rays (projectors) emanate from a Center of Projection (COP) and 
intersect Projection Plane (PP). The COP for parallel projectors is at infinity. 
The length of a line on the projection plane is the same as the "true 
Length".</P>

<P>There are two different types of parallel projections:<BR>If the direction of 
projection is perpendicular to the projection plane then it is an 
<STRONG>orthographic </STRONG>projection. If the direction of projection is not 
perpendicular to the projection plane then it is an <STRONG>oblique</STRONG> 
projection. </P>
<P>Look at the parallel projection of a point (x, y, z). (Note the left handed 
coordinate system). The projection plane is at z = 0. x, y are the orthographic 
projection values and xp, yp are the oblique projection values (at angle a with 
the projection plane)</P>

<P>Look at orthographic projection: it is simple, just discard the z 
coordinates. Engineering drawings frequently use front, side, top orthographic 
views of an object.</P>
<P>Here are three orthographic views of an object.</P>
<P><IMG height=341 src="Parallel Viewing Projections_files/3dproj4.gif" 
width=480></P>
<P>Orthographic projections that show more than 1 side of an object are called 
<STRONG>axonometric </STRONG>orthographic projections. The most common 
axonometric projection is an <STRONG>isometric </STRONG>projection where the 
projection plane intersects each coordinate axis in the model coordinate system 
at an equal distance.</P>
<P><STRONG>Isometric Projection</STRONG></P>
<P><IMG height=269 src="Parallel Viewing Projections_files/3dproj5.gif" 
width=416></P>
<P>The projection plane intersects the x, y, z axes at equal distances and the 
projection plane Normal makes an equal angle with the three axes. </P>
<P>To form an orthographic projection xp = x, yp= y , zp = 0. To form different 
types e.g., Isometric, just manipulate object with 3D transformations.</P>
<P><STRONG>Oblique Projection</STRONG></P>
<P><IMG height=229 src="Parallel Viewing Projections_files/3dproj3.gif" 
width=368></P>
<P>The projectors are not perpendicular to the projection plane but are parallel 
from the object to the projection plane The projectors are defined by two angles 
A and d where:<BR>A = angle of line (x,y,xp,yp) with projection plane, <BR>d = 
angle of line (x, y, xp, yp) with x axis in projection plane<BR>L = Length of 
Line (x,y,xp,yp).</P>
<P>Then: <BR>cos d = (xp - x) / L ------&gt; xp = x + Lcos d ,<BR>sin d = (yp - 
y) / L ------&gt; yp = y + Lsin d , <BR>tan A = z / L</P><PRE>Now define L1 = L / z	----&gt;	L= L1 z ,
so tan A = z / L = 1 / L1 ; xp = x + z(L1cos d) ; yp = y + z(L1sin d) </PRE><PRE>    |1      0      0 0 |
P = |0      1      0 0 |
    |L1cosq L1sinq 1 0 |
    |0      0      0 1 |
</PRE>
<P>Now if A = 90° (projection line is perpendicular to PP) then tanA = infinity 
=&gt; L1 = 0, so have an rthographic projection.</P>
<P>Two special cases of oblique projection <BR>A) A = 45° , tanA = 1 =&gt; L1 = 
1 This is a <STRONG>Cavalier </STRONG>projection such that all lines 
perpendicular to the projection planeare projected with no change in length.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>B) tanA = 2, A= 63.40°, L1 = 1 / 2<BR>Lines which are perpendicular to the 
projection planeare projected at 1 / 2 length . This is a 
<STRONG>Cabinet</STRONG> projection.</P>

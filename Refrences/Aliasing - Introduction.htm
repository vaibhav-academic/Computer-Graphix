<H1 align=center>Introduction to Aliasing</H1>
<P>Aliasing is a potential problem whenever an analog signal is point sampled to 
convert it into a digital signal. It can occur in audio sampling, for example, 
in converting music to digital form to be stored on a CD-ROM or other digital 
device. Aliasing happens whenever an analog signal is not sampled at a high 
enough frequency. In audio, Aliasing manifests itself in the form of spurious 
low frequencies. An example is shown below of two sin waves.</P>

<P>In the top sin wave, the sampling is fast enough that a reconstructed signal 
(the small circles) would have the same frequency as the original sin wave. In 
the bottom wave, with a higher frequency but the same point sampling rate, a 
reconstructed signal (the small circles) would appear to be a sin wave of a 
lower frequency, i.e., an <I>aliased</I> signal.</P>
<P>From <A 
href="http://www.siggraph.org/education/materials/HyperGraph/aliasing/alias3.htm">Point 
Sampling Theory</A> it turns out that to accurately reconstruct a signal, the 
signal must be sampled at a rate greater than or equal to two times the highest 
frequency contained in the signal. This is called the Nyquist Theorem and the 
highest frequency that can be accurately represented with a given sampling rate 
is called the Nyquist limit. For example, to produce a music CD-ROM the analog 
signal is sampled at a maximum rate of 44 Khz, therefore the highest possible 
audio frequency is 22khz. Any audio frequencies greater than 22Khz must be 
removed from the input signal or they will be aliased, i.e., appear as low 
frequency sounds. </P>
<P>Aliasing occurs in <A 
href="http://www.siggraph.org/education/materials/HyperGraph/aliasing/alias2a.htm">computer 
graphics</A>, since we are point sampling an analog signal. The mathematical 
model of an image is a continuous analog signal which is sampled at discrete 
points (the pixel positions). When the sampling rate is less than Nyquist Limit 
then there are aliasing artifacts that are called "jaggies" in computer 
graphics. In general, aliasing is when high frequencies appear as low 
frequencies which produce regular patterns easy to see. </P>

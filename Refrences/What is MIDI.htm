<P>MIDI, which means:</P>
<H2>Musical Instrument Digital Interface,</H2>
<P>is a digital communications protocol. In August of 1983, music manufacturers 
agreed on a document that is called "MIDI 1.0 Specification". Any device that 
has MIDI capabilities must adhere to this specific data structure to ensure that 
all MIDI devices are capable of working together. This protocol is a language 
that allows interworking between instruments from different manufacturers by 
providing a link that is capable of transmitting and receiving digital data. It 
is important to remember that MIDI transmits commands, but it does not transmit 
an audio signal. <BR><BR>The MIDI specification includes a common language that 
provides information about events, such as note on and off, preset changes, 
sustain pedal, pitch bend, and timing information. The specification has been 
updated more recently with specific data structures for handling sample dumps, 
MIDI time code, general MIDI and standard MIDI files. To see a complete listing 
of all MIDI data, go to: <A

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR><BR>MIDI information is transmitted through a MIDI cable 
that has DIN-type male plug connectors with five pins. Two of the pins are used 
to transfer digital binary information (MIDI Code). One of the pins issues a 
steady stream of five volts, while the other pin alternates between 5 volts and 
0 volts to represent binary information (on and off). The third pin is a ground 
and the remaining two pins are currently not in use.</P>

    <TD height=105>&nbsp;The MIDI data is sent down the cable one bit at a 
      time as a stream of information, which is called a <B>serial 
      interface</B>. A <B>parallel interface</B> allows the information to be 
      sent down separate wires so that the message reaches the device at the 
      same time, making it faster than a serial interface. Computer chips 
      communicate via a parallel interface.</TD></TR>

    <TD width="57%">&nbsp;The serial interface was chosen by MIDI 
      manufacturers because it is less expensive and more efficient than a 
      parallel interface. The speed of a MIDI serial interface is <B>31,250 bits 
      per second</B>. There are 10 bits needed for every MIDI digital word or 
      <B>3125 messages per second</B>. Snap your finger and think about how many 
      many events could be transmitted during that time. Consequently, the 
      serial interface speed is more than adequate for most music 
    applications.</TD>
    <TD width="43%">In order to really understand the concept of digital 
      information, we must be familiar with the decimal, binary and hexadecimal 
      counting systems. <A

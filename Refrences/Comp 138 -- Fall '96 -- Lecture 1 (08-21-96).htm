<CENTER>Cathode Ray Tubes (CRTs)</CENTER></H2>
<P>CRTs, or video monitors, are the most common output device on computers 
today. The figure below illustrates the basic structure of a CRT. A CRT is an 
evacuated glass bottle, with a heating element on one end and a phosphor coated 
screen on the other. When a current flows through this heating element, called a 
filament, the conductivity of the metal filamant is reduced due to the high 
temperature. This cause electrons to pile up on the filament, because they can 
not move as fast as they would like to (Notice I'm wearing my 
"electrons-are-particles" hat). Some of these electrons actually <I>boil off</I> 
of the filament.</P>
<P>These free electrons are attracted to a strong positive charge from the outer 
surface of the focusing anode cylinder (sometines called an electrostic lens). 
However, the inside of the cylinder has a weaker negative charge. Thus when the 
electrons head toward the anode they are forced into a beam and accelerated by 
the repulsion of the inner cylinder walls in just the way that water is speeds 
up when its flow though a smaller diameter pipe. By the time the electrons get 
out they're going so fast that they fly past the cathode they were heading 
for.</P>
<P>The next thing that the electrons run into are two sets of weakly charged 
deflection plates. These plates have opposite charges, one positive the other 
negative. While their charge is not strong enough to capture the fast moving 
electrons they do influence the path of the beam. The first set displaces the 
beam up and down, and the second displaces the beam left and right. The 
electrons are sent flying out of the neck of the bottle, called a <I>yolk</I>, 
until they smash into the phosphor coating on the other end of the bottle. The 
impact of this colission on the out valence bands of the phophor compounds 
knocks some of the electrons to jump into the another band. This causes a few 
photons to be generated, and results in our seeing a spot on the CRT's face.</P>

<P>CRTs were embraced as output devices very early in the development of digital 
computers. There close cousins, vacuum tubes, were some of the first switching 
elements used to build computers. Today, the CRT is a the last remaining vacuum 
tube in most systems (Even the flashing lights are solid-state LEDs).</P>
<P>Most likely, oscilloscopes were some of the first computer graphics displays. 
The results of computations could be used to directly drive the vertical and 
horizontal displacement plates in order to draw lines on the CRT's face. By 
varying the current to the heating filament the output of the electron beam 
could also be controlled. This allowed the intensity of the lines to vary from 
bright to completely dark.
<P>
<P>These early CRT displays were called <I>vector</I>, <I>calligraphic</I> or 
affectionately <I>stroker</I> displays. The following demostration gives some 
feel for how they worked.</P>
<CENTER><APPLET height=300 width=300 code=ThreeD.class><PARAM NAME="height" VALUE="300"><PARAM NAME="width" VALUE="300"><PARAM NAME="code" VALUE="ThreeD.class"><PARAM NAME="codeBase" VALUE="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~mcmillan/comp136/Lecture1/"></APPLET></CENTER>
<P>By the way, this demo is an active Java applet. You can click and drag your 
mouse inside of the image to reorient the CRT for a better view. Notice the 
<I>wireframe</I> nature of the displayed image. This demo is complicated by the 
fact that it's a wireframe simulation of a wireframe display system. Notice how 
the color of the gray lines of the CRT vary from dark to light indicating which 
parts of the model that are closer to the viewer. This technique is called 
<I>depth-cueing</I>, and it was used frequently on vector displays. The 
intensity vriations seen on the teapot, however, are for a different reason. 
Eventaully, the phosphors recover from their excited state and the displaced 
electrons return back to their original bands. The glow of the phosphor fades. 
Thus, the image on the CRT's face must be constantly redrawn, refreshed, or 
updated.</P>
<P>The two primary problems with vector displays are that they required constant 
updates to avoid fading, thus limiting the drawn scene's complexity, and they 
only drew wireframes.</P>

<P>During the late 50s and early 60s, broadcast televison, really began to take 
off. It had been around for a while, but it didn't become a commodity item until 
about this time. Televisions are basically just oscilloscopes. The main 
difference is that instead of having complete control over the vertical and 
horizontal deflection, a television sweeps its trace across the entire face in a 
regular fixed pattern (the actual details are slightly more complicated, but 
that's the jist of it). This scanning pattern proceeds from the top-left of the 
screen to the bottom-right as shown in the diagram. The final result is that the 
entire screen is painted once every 1/30th of a second (33 mS).</P>
<P>Televisions were mass produced and inexpensive. For a computer to paint the 
entire screen it needs only to synchronize its painting with the constant 
scanning pattern of the raster. The solution to this problem was to add a 
special memory which opreated synchronous to the raster scanning of the TV. But, 
while televisions were cheap, memory wasn't. So there was a long period where 
the patterns were scanned out of a cheap high-density read-only memories, called 
<I>character generators</I>. The trick was to use a single 8 bit code to specify 
an 8 by 12 character pattern from the ROM, and with a few addressing tricks one 
could build a nice display (80 by 25 character) with only 2 kilobytes of memory. 
Thus the era of the CRT-terminal was born.</P>
<P>There were a few attempts at building systems with downloadable or 
programmable character generators. And a few systems added an extra byte to 
specify the foreground and background colors of the character cell. Lots of 
tank/maze arcade games in the 70's worked this way. But by the late 70's and 
early 80's the price of memory started a free-fall and the graphics terminal was 
born. Next lecture we'll go into a lot more detail about how the notion of a 
framebuffer is fundamental to modern computer graphics.</P>

<P>Color CRT's are more complicated than the simple monochrome models summarized 
above. The phosphors on the face of a color CRT are laid out in a precise 
geometric pattern. There are two primary variations, the <I>stripe</I> pattern 
of in-line tubes shown on the left, and the <I>delta</I> pattern of delta tubes 
as shown on the right.</P>
<P>Within the neck of the CRT there are three electron guns, one each for red, 
green, and blue (the actual beams are all the same color-- <I>invisible</I>). 
There is also a special metal plate just behind the phosphor cover front face, 
called a <I>shadow mask</I>. This mask is aligned so that it simultaneously 
allows each electron beam to see only the phosphors of its assigned color and 
blocks the phosphor of the remaining two colors.</P>

<P>The figure shown above shows the configuration of an example in-line tube. On 
page 44 of <B>Hearn &amp; Baker</B> you'll see a similar diagram for a delta 
electron gun configuration</P>
<P>A significant portion of the electron beam's energy strikes the mask rather 
than the phosphors. This has two side effects. The shadow mask has to be 
extremely rigid to stay aligned with the phosphor patterns on the CRT face. The 
collision of electrons with metal mask causes the mask to emit some of it 
absorbed energy as eletromagnetic radiation. Most of this energy is in the form 
of heat, but some fraction is emitted as x-rays. X-rays can present a health 
hazard. This wasn't a large problem for television because the intensity of the 
x-ray radiation falls off quickly as you move away from the screen. However, 
computer monitors are supposed to be viewed from a short distance. This health 
concern along with the high voltages and power dispations of CRTs has motivated 
the development of new display technologies.</P>

<CENTER>Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs)</CENTER></H2>Currently the most popular 
alternative to the CRT is the Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). LCDs are organic 
molecules that, in the absence of external forces, tend to align themselves in 
crystalline structures. But, when an external force is applied they will 
rearrange themselves as if they were a liquid. Some liquid crystals respond to 
heat (i.e. <I>mood rings</I>), others respond to electromagnetic forces.
<P></P>
<P>When LCDs are used as optical (light) modulators they are actually changing 
polarization rather than transparency (at least this is true for the most 
popular type of LCD called <I>Super-twisted Nematic Liquid crystals</I>). In 
their unexcited or crystalline state the LCDs rotate the polarization of light 
by 90 degrees. In the presence of an electric field, LCDs behave like a liquid 
and align the small electrostatic charges of the molecules with the impinging E 
field.

<P>The book <B>Hearns &amp; Baker</B> is a little confusing in describing how 
LCDs work (pp. 47-48). They call the relaxed state the "On State" and the 
excited state the "Off State". Their statement is only true from the point of 
view of the pixels when the LCDs are used in a <I>transmissive mode</I> (like on 
most laptops). The opposite is true when the LCDs are used in a <I>reflective 
mode</I> (like on watches).</P>
<P>The LCD's transition between crystalline and liquid states is a slow process. 
This has both good and bad side effects. LCDs, like phosphors, remain "on" for 
some time after the E field is applied. Thus the image is <I>persistent</I> like 
a CRT's, but this lasts just until the crystals can realign themselves, thus 
they must be constantly refreshed, again, like a CRT.</P>

<P>Rather than generating light like a CRTs, LCDs act as light values. 
Therefore, they are dependent on some external light source. In the case of a 
transmissive display, usually some sort of <I>back light</I> is used. Reflective 
displays take advantage of the ambient light. Thus, transmissive displays are 
difficult to see when they are overwhelmed by external light sources, whereas 
reflective displays can't be seen in the dark. You should also note that at 
least half of the light is lost in most LCD configurations. Can you see why?</P>

<P>The LCD's themselves have extremely low power requirements. A very small 
eletric field is required to excite the crystals into their liquid state. Most 
of the energy used by an LCD display system is due to the back lighting.</P>
<P>I mentioned earlier that LCD's slowly transition back to their crtstalline 
state when the E field is removed. In scanned displays, with a large number of 
pixels, the percentage of the time that LCDs are excited is very small. Thus the 
crystals spend most of their time in intermediate states, being neither "On" or 
"Off". This behavior is indicative of <I>passive displays</I>. You might notice 
that these displays are not very sharp and are prone to ghosting. Another way to 
building LCD displays uses an <I>active matrix</I>. The individual cells are 
very similar to those described above. The main difference is that the electic 
field is retained by a capacitor so that the crystal remains in a constant 
state. Transistor switches are used to transfer charge into the capacitors 
during the scanning process. The capacitors can hold the charge for 
significantly longer than the refresh period yeilding a crisp display with no 
shadows. Active displays, require a working capacitor and transistor for each 
LCD or pixel element, and thus, they are more expensive to produce.</P>

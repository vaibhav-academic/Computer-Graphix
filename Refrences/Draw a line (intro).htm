<H1>Draw a line (intro)</H1>Drawing a line on a computer monitor is harder than 
on paper. Paper is analog and you can just draw a line from point a to point b. 
On a computer screen this is not the case. The screen is digital, made up of 
discreet pixels laid out in a grid. Think of the screen as a sheet of graph 
paper. Each pixel is like a square on the paper, and can only be one color.
<P>Here is a line from (2,2) to (19,9). You can see that it has a bit of a 
wiggle to it.

<P>Here it is magnified, and the reason for the wiggle (called the jaggies) 
becomes apparent. 
<P><IMG src="Draw a line (intro)_files/shortline.xbm"> 
<P>Notice the steps, these are caused by trying to draw a diagonal with squares 
laid out in a coordinate system. These squares are aliased from the position of 
the line in that colnmn. The white squares are the centers of the pixels.

that drew this line is written for the special case of lines in the first 
octant. A line can be draw here and then mirrored to provide generality.

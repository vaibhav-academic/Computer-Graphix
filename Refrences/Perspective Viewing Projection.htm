<H1 align=center>Perspective Viewing Projection</H1>
<P>The Perspective viewing projection has a Center of Projection ("eye") at a 
finite distance from the projection plane (PP).</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG height=177 src="Perspective Viewing Projection_files/3dproj9.gif" 
width=489></P>
<P>So the distance of a line from the projection plane determines its size on 
the projection plane, i.e. the farther the line is from the projection plane, 
the smaller its image on the projection plane. In the two images above, the 
projections of L1 = L2 but the actual length of L1 &lt;&gt; L2. Perspective 
projection is more realistic since distant objects appear smaller.</P>
<H3>Computing the Perspective Projection</H3>
<P><IMG height=253 src="Perspective Viewing Projection_files/3dproj10.gif" 
width=372></P>
<P>Look at above diagram from y axis</P>
<P><IMG height=204 src="Perspective Viewing Projection_files/3dproj11.gif" 
width=367></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Now x / (z+d) = xp/d<BR>xp = x[d / (z+d)]<BR>xp = x / (z / d + 1)</P>
<P>Do same for y (look down the x axis) and get <BR>y p = y / (z / d+1) <BR>zp = 
0</P>
<P>Note that we can increase the perspective effect by decreasing d (moving 
closer). We can represent this in matrix form by using homogeneuos coordinates 
as follows:</P><PRE>[xh yh zh w]=[x y z 1]	|1 0 0 0 |
			|0 1 0 0 |
			|0 0 01/d|
			|0 0 0 1 |	</PRE>
<P>where:<BR>xh = x<BR>yh= y<BR>zh = 0<BR>w = (z/d) + 1<BR><BR>And Points on the 
projection plane are [xp yp zp 1] = [xh/w yh/w zh/w 1]<BR>This leads to the same 
xp, yp as before.</P>
<P>A problem with a perspective transformation is that it does not preserve 
straight lines or planes, i.e., straight lines are not transformed into straight 
lines and planes are no longer planar after the transformation.</P>
<P>Look at example of a 3D line in object space from: <BR>P1 (x1 = 2.0, y1 = 
5.0, z1 = 6.0) to P2 (x2 = 8.0, y2 = 7.0, z2 = 12.0)</P>
<P>In parametric form this line is represented as: <BR>x(t) = 2 + 6 × t<BR>y(t) 
= 5 + 2 × t<BR>z(t) = 6 + 6 × t</P>
<P>Let us choose an arbitrary value of t (t = 0.4) and compute the x, y, z 
values)</P>
<P>x = 2 + 2 × 0.4 = 4.4<BR>y = 5 + 2 × 0.4 = 5.8 so Pi(t = 0.4) = (4.4, 5.8, 
8.4)<BR>z = 6 + 6 × 0.4 = 8.4 </P>
<P>Now perform the perspective transformation (assume d = 10.0) for P1, Pi, P2. 
Then we get for the transformed points:</P>
<P>P1(x = 1.25, y = 3.125, z = 6); Pi(x = 2.39, y = 3.15, z = 8.4);<BR>P2(x = 
3.64, y = 3.18, z = 12)</P>
<P>If this is still a straight line then all three coordinates of point Pi must 
have the same value of the parameter t.</P>
<P>so for x we get 2.39 = 1.25 + t × (2.39) =&gt;t = 0.48<BR>for y we get 3.15 = 
3.12 + t × (0.57) =&gt; t = 0.48<BR>for z we get t = 0.40 since unchanged =&gt; 
therefore the points are not collinear.</P>
<P>To maintain linearity we can do a perspective depth transformation:</P>
<P>Zp = Z / (D + Z)</P>
<P>Then for point 1 Zp = 6 / (10+6) = .375<BR>point 2 Zp = 12 / (10+12) = 
.545<BR>point i Zp = 8.4 / (10+8.4) = .457</P>
<P>Now check with t value for point i 0.457 = 0.375 + t * (0.170) = .48. This is 
the same t value we got for point i x and y. Therefore points 1, 2, and i are 
still colinear after the perspective depth transformation.. Note that the 
relative z depth values remain unchanged, i.e. if Z1 &lt; Z2 then Z1 / (Z1+d) 
&lt; Z2 / (Z2+d) as shown below:</P>
<P>Z1 &lt; Z2<BR>Z1 × d &lt; Z2 × d multiply both sides by d<BR>(Z1 × Z2 + Z1 × 
d) &lt; (Z1 × Z2 + Z2 × d) add Z1 × Z2 to both sides<BR>Z1 × (Z2 + d) &lt; Z2 × 
(Z1 + d)<BR>Z1 / (Z1 + d) &lt; Z2 / (Z2 + d)</P>
<P>Note that for Zp = Z / (Z+d) =&gt; 0 if d &gt;&gt; Z and =&gt; 1.0 if Z 
&gt;&gt; d<BR>therefore 0.0 &lt;= Zp &lt;= 1.0</P>
<P>So to maintain linearity (or planarity) we must transform Z as well as X and 
Y.</P>
<H3>Vanishing Points</H3>
<P>Any set of parallel lines that are not parallel to the projection plane will 
converge to a vanishing point.If the set of lines is parallel to one of the 
three principal axis then it is called a principal vanishing point. </P>

    <TD width="50%">In this image the X and Y lines are parallel to the Z 
      axis. Since the projection plane is normal to the Z axis there is only one 
      principal vanishing point. Lines parallel to either X or Y axis are 
      parallel to projection planeand have no vanishing point. So it is a 
      one-point projection. </TD>

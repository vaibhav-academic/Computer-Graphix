<H3>What this document covers and what it doesn't</H3>There seems to be a lot of 
confusion about the huge number of different video recording formats and their 
specifications. Information is widely scattered and hard to find. This document 
will mostly cover professional and semi-pro formats, both those in use now and 
those being under development. If you want to know about "consumer" formats, 
check out <A href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~leopold/Ld/VideoFormats.html">this</A>.
<P>For the time being, there isn't much information on analogue formats, but I 
will be adding more stuff as I come across it. Unless noted, all information 
applies to PAL 625/50 versions. I'm omitting SECAM on purpose, because it's 
rarely used for studio work anyway.
<P>Many of the figures have been extracted from manufacturers' brochures and do 
not necessarily represent the best a given recording format can offer. 
Nevertheless, they should be pretty close.
<P>And to keep things in perspective, let me remind you that 16 mm film beats 
the living daylights out of most formats depicted here, especially when it comes 
to dynamic range.

<H3>Notes on specifications and nomenclature</H3>
<H4>Broadcast quality defined - not!</H4>The rest of this document, as well as 
many other texts handling video production, will frequently refer to "broadcast 
quality" without really defining what it is. Such a definition doesn't really 
exist -- many people think of it as describing the minimum quality for a program 
that is to be broadcast. There is no technical standard for this, and in fact, 
almost any crap can be restored to good enough quality with time base correctors 
and other digital processing.
<P>From the technical point of view, broadcast quality can be thought of as a 
video signal fulfilling the timing and signal level tolerances placed by the 
relevant international standards. This doesn't say anything about the bandwidth 
(resolution) or signal-to-noise ratio of the actual picture -- that remains to 
be judged from the highly untechnical point of view: considering the contents of 
the program, is the picture watchable enough? Now that there are plenty of good 
recording formats available, broadcast quality recording usually means something 
that isn't noticeably worse than direct composite video from a good camera. 
<H4>Composite vs. component</H4>In this context, component video means colour 
video represented by three separate signals (luminance and two colour difference 
signals). This is commonly referred to as Y/Cr/Cb colour space. RGB is almost 
never used in recording, because it requires 3/2 times the bandwidth of Y/Cr/Cb 
representation in order to achieve similar subjective quality. Some video 
equipment may still have RGB inputs or outputs, as converting between these two 
component representations is easy; see the equations at <A 
href="http://www.well.com/user/rld/vidpage/color.html">Rick Davis' digital video 
page</A> (that's for NTSC, by the way -- PAL uses slightly different 
coefficients). Charles Poynton's excellent <A 
href="http://www.inforamp.net/~poynton/Poynton-color.html">FAQs on colour and 
gamma</A> should answer the rest of your questions.
<P>S-Video (or Y/C) does not count as component video, as most externally 
composite formats use separate chrominance and luminance signals in recording 
anyway. Additionally, the chrominance signal of S-video is already modulated in 
either PAL or NTSC to ride on a subcarrier and as such is limited in bandwidth. 
Component video does not have this limitation. 
<H4>Bandwidth and lines</H4>Both of these figures refer to the horizontal 
resolution. "Lines" refers to the number of <EM>vertical</EM> alternating black 
and white lines that can be stuffed in the picture and still be perceived as 
separate lines and not a gray mass. It's clear that this is not a very 
scientific definition of resolution when the signal is in the continuos domain, 
like it is with all analogue formats. Therefore, the bandwidth is better 
expressed as the real electrical signal bandwidth fitting inside some dB limits, 
which can be easily measured.
<P>As you are bound to come across bandwidth specifications in both lines and 
frequencies, here's how to convert from lines to bandwidth: <PRE>           4/3 * resolution in lines
    BW = -----------------------------  / 2.
         length of active picture line
</PRE>The divisor 2 comes from the fact that you need two lines (black and 
white) to represent a single sine wave cycle. To make things complicated, even 
the horizontal line resolution is usually expressed as <EM>the number of lines 
that could be reproduced vertically, if the horizontal and vertical resolutions 
were equal</EM>. Therefore the equation contains the multiplier 4/3, which comes 
from the aspect ratio of television screen. I doubt that all advertisers and 
salesmen know this.
<P>For 625/50 PAL, the length of the active (visible) part of the picture line 
is 52 us, so for example the 240 line horizontal luminance resolution of VHS 
becomes <PRE>    4/3 * 240
    --------- / 2 = 3 MHz
      52e-6
</PRE>worth of bandwidth. Of course, we don't know the dB limits for this 
figure, because nobody told us how gray those 240 "black and white" lines got. 
For this reason, respectable +/- 1 dB bandwidth specifications may look worse 
than the same picture quality expressed in lines (which is why lines are 
preferred in advertisements). Reversing the equation to get from bandwidth to 
lines is left as an exercise to the reader.
<P>In the specs for component formats, the expressed colour bandwidth applies to 
both of the colour components separately.
<P><B>Note:</B> This simplified discussion omits some important points, but will 
suffice for the usual 4:3 aspect ratio TV systems. If you want the dirty 
details, consult a good text book like <A 
href="http://www.hut.fi/~iisakkil/videoformats.html#ref">[2]</A>. Furthermore, 
this conversion method isn't valid for chrominance bandwidth and resolution (I'm 
still trying to figure out exactly why, but I suppose it's because the colour 
bandwidth in composite video is limited to some 1.5 MHz in any case). 
<H4>But what about vertical resolution?</H4>Unlike the horizontal direction, the 
vertical direction of television picture is discrete and not continuous. Still, 
on the picture tube the lines overlap and are not normally perceived as 
separate. For this reason (and others, like the <EM>Kell factor</EM>, but I've 
digressed enough already from the original point of this document), the vertical 
resolution of TV is not such a big deal. If it were, people would have abandoned 
525 line NTSC long time ago. As all of the analogue formats record picture lines 
totally independently of each other (with some exceptions, see below), there is 
no need to state the vertical resolution. It is always the same as in the video 
format itself -- 575 visible lines in PAL, 485 in NTSC.
<P>The same story applies to the digital formats which are represented here. 
None of them throw away every other line, like CD-i for example does. Even the 
formats using compression maintain the entire vertical resolution, although all 
the compression methods are two-dimensional and operate on the image as a whole 
and not on separate lines.
<P>One can argue that that in PAL, the principle used for colour phase error 
cancellation reduces the vertical chroma resolution by half. But, this doesn't 
happen until in the receiver - the video recorders and the PAL video itself 
still carry the full vertical colour resolution. The exceptions here are VHS and 
S-VHS, where the method used for track-to-track chrominance crosstalk reduction 
really cuts the vertical chroma resolution to half <EM>on the tape</EM>. The 
chrominance also moves down in the picture. This is hardly notable in the first 
generation (cf. PAL), but unfortunately degenerates during each copy, so second 
and third generation VHS copies get barely acceptable and poor, respectively. 
The results can be seen as those famous "carved-with-an-axe" images.

<H3>Digital formats employing compression</H3>With compressed digital formats, 
bandwidth doesn't make as much sense as without compression or with analogue 
video. Quantization (sampling) type and the compression ratio are more 
interesting; most of these formats use quantization according to <A 
href="http://www.crs4.it/~luigi/MPEG/ccir601.html">CCIR Rec. 601</A>, <A 
href="http://www.hut.fi/~iisakkil/videoformats.html#ref">[1]</A>, which is 
widely considered as the specification for "broadcast quality" when it comes to 
digital video. The most common CCIR 601 subformat is 4:2:2 quantization with 720 
active samples per line. 4:2:2 means Y/Cr/Cb (YUV) format video, where the 
sampling rate for both of the colour difference signals is half the sampling 
frequency of the luminance. <PRE>Format           Quantization    Compression       S/N       Audio

<A name=backgr></A>
<H3>Some background on the formats</H3>Since many of these recording formats, 
especially the digital ones, are almost unknown outside the broadcasting 
companies wealthy enough to use them, I've decided to include some background 
information on them too. <A name=betacamsp></A>
<H4>Betacam SP</H4>Developed by Sony, perhaps the most popular component format 
for both field acquisition and post production today. Betacam uses cassettes and 
transports similar to the old Betamax home video format, but the similarities 
end there. Tape speed is six times higher, and luminance and chrominance are 
recorded on two separate tracks. The two colour difference signals are 
compressed in time by two and recorded sequentially on a single track. <A 
name=m2></A>
<H4>M-II</H4><EM>M-II</EM> (read <EM>em-two</EM>) was developed by Matsushita 
for Japan's national broadcasting company NHK. Today M-II is one of the most 
popular broadcast quality component formats with quality similar to Betacam SP. 
Large users of M-II include NHK, of course, and NBC. Recording technique is 
similar to Betacam SP but uses some enhancements which compensate for the lower 
tape speed. <A name=cformat></A>
<H4>EBU C format</H4>These machines use 1" tape in open reels. The main 
advantages are very fast transports and low recording density, which makes the 
format rather immune to drop-outs. Tape costs are high. The units can record 
single frames, which makes them popular in computer animation. Some units with 
vacuum capstans can operate from stop to nominal speed within one video field. 
The tape makes almost a full circle around the picture drum, and a single head 
is able to record and playback the entire video signal (short of a few lines 
right after vertical sync). Most other helical scan formats have at least two 
picture heads, which alternate between fields.
<P>Note that in C format, the entire composite video signal is recorded and 
played back as is without splitting it to Y/C, like most composite recorders do, 
or limiting the bandwidth in any way. Numerous manufacturers include Sony, Ampex 
and BTS. <A name=bformat></A>
<H4>EBU B format</H4>Similar to C format, but uses segmented helical scan. The 
diameter of the picture drum is small, and a single video field is recorded in 6 
separate tracks. Manufactured by Bosch. B format doesn't allow for many special 
modes - play, FF and REW are just about it. <A name=umatic></A>
<H4>U-Matic</H4>Another format by Sony. Has three different versions (LB, HB and 
SP), which differ by the subcarrier frequencies used for luminance and 
chrominance recording. U-Matic LB (Low Band) has been around from the early 70s 
and is one of the oldest cassette video formats. HB (High Band) has increased 
chroma subcarrier frequency, which improves colour resolution. In the SP 
variant, both chroma and luma subcarrier frequencies have been increased.
<P>U-Matic SP (in common lingo "3/4" after the tape width in inches) is still a 
popular production format for those not wealthy enough to use Beta SP or 
similar. Although U-Matic doesn't appear much better than Super VHS on paper, 
the higher colour resolution and much better signal-to-noise ratio make the 
picture subjectively far more enjoyable. The U-Matic tape transport is also much 
faster in changing modes, which makes editing less frustrating.
<P>LB and HB U-Matic tapes are often used for archiving because of the 
relatively low tape costs and low recording density, which makes the tapes 
robust against aging. <A name=dseries></A>
<H4>D series digital formats</H4><EM>D-1</EM> was the first practical digital 
format, introduced by Sony in 1986. Although still considered a quality 
reference, D-1 is expensive to buy and use and has been mostly superseded by the 
more cost effective later formats.
<P><EM>D-2</EM> was developed by Ampex around the same time as D-1 was 
introduced and is meant to be a fully transparent storage for composite video, 
useful for composing "spot tapes" for programmes such as news.
<P><EM>D-3</EM> and <EM>D-5</EM> have both been developed by Matsushita. D-5 
units can use two different sample rate / resolution combinations and are 
generally capable of playing back D-3 tapes. While D-5 is still a studio format, 
D-3 camcorders are available from Panasonic.
<P>A high definition version of D-5 (<EM>D-5 HD</EM>) has been introduced by 
Panasonic. It uses 4:1 compression in order to accomodate the 1.2 Gbps HDTV data 
rate. It can work with both 1080 line interlaced or 720 line progressive 
(American) HDTV formats.
<P><EM>D-6</EM> is a digital HDTV recording format by Toshiba/BTS. Stores 600 GB 
worth of data on a physically huge 64 minute cassette. I was told that this 
format is more or less dead and the remaining tape transports were bought out by 
Toshiba - but in <A href="http://www.ibc.org.uk/ibc/">IBC'97</A>, I saw a D-6 
recorder in action, demonstrated as a joint venture between Toshiba and some 
other Japanese manufacturer, whose name escapes me. The picture quality was 
truly impressive. 
<P><A href="http://www.hut.fi/~iisakkil/videoformats.html#dvc">DVCPRO</A> should 
become D-7 later. Also, <A 
href="http://www.hut.fi/~iisakkil/videoformats.html#digitals">Digital-S</A> will 
be designated as D-9 [unconfirmed].
<P>As a curiosity, D-4 doesn't exist, as number 4 is a major taboo in Asian 
cultures (pronounced the same as "death" in Japanese). Rumours go that this even 
delayed the standardization of D-3 and D-5. <A name=digitalbeta></A>
<H4>Digital Betacam</H4>Digital successor to the venerable Betacam SP format. 
Introduced by Sony in 1993, uses physically similar half-inch cassettes. 
Camcorders with 40-minute capacity are available, making Digital Betacam the 
first component digital ENG (electronic news gathering) format. Digital Betacam 
units play back, but do not record analogue Beta SP tapes.
<P>The 2:1 compression is based on DCT (discrete cosine transform), like most 
modern video compression techniques. Each field is compressed separately. <A

<H4>Ampex DCT</H4>So far, fully proprietary format by Ampex (1992). Name is an 
acronym for "Digital Component Technology" and not for what you'd expect. 
According to Ampex, the main advantage of DCT over other digital formats is high 
tolerance for data errors, in the order of one uncorrected error per hour.
<P>The units can switch between 525/60 and 625/50 operation, and allow a maximum 
recording time of more than three hours. These qualities give the DCT format a 
central role in Ampex' <A

scheme</A>. <A name=dvc></A>
<H4>DV/DVCam/DVCPRO</H4><EM>DV</EM> (formerly <EM>DVC</EM>) is a new format 
being backed by manufacturers such as Sony, Philips, Thomson, Hitachi, 
Matsushita (Panasonic) and others. It was the first digital recording format in 
the reach of consumer markets. DV uses 5:1 compression based on DCT. Depending 
on the image contents, the encoder adaptively decides whether to compress 
picture fields separately or combine two fields into a single compression block. 
As such, DV coding can be thought of as something half-way between Motion JPEG 
and MPEG.
<P>As a curiosity, the consumer version (DV) sports one of the densest recording 
techniques based on magnetic tape media - more than 0.4 megabits per square 
millimeter. Imagine the data from your 3.5" HD floppy recorded on a single-sided 
5x6 mm piece of tape. New equipment from Sony will push this even further with 
the deployment of LP mode, which will reduce the track width to 6.67 um and 
multiply the recording time by 1.5. Video specifications will remain the 
same.</P><EM>DVCPRO</EM> is a professional variant of the DV by Panasonic. The 
only major difference is doubled tape speed, which is needed for better drop-out 
tolerance and general recording robustness. It is also capable of 4x normal 
speed playback. This doesn't mean your run-of-the-mill FF with picture, but 
accelerated transfer of all of the information into for example a non-linear 
editing system. <EM>DVCAM</EM> on the other hand is Sony's variation of the 
theme, sitting somewhere between DV and DVCPRO. Tape speed and track width have 
been increased, but not as much as for DVCPRO. Furthermore, it uses the same 
metal evaporated tape as DV, while DVCPRO uses metal particle tape. What exactly 
Sony expects from this format is quite puzzling, given that they already have 
two other digital ENG formats - Betacam SX and Digital Betacam.
<P>These similar, but still different digital formats have made some people to 
fear for another War of the Formats, the players this time being Panasonic and 
Sony. But because the formats mainly differ in the way they store the data on 
the tape, the data itself being the same, the situation isn't quite that sad. 
Actually Panasonic has announced that their upcoming DVCPRO gear will be able to 
play back DVCAM recordings; according to Panasonic, this will only require 
reprogramming the capstan servo systems to accomodate for the slightly different 
track width (15 um in DVCAM vs. 18 um in DVCPRO) and therefore different tape 
speed.
<P>As for the picture quality, all these variants are nearly broadcast quality, 
DV being available at nearly consumer prices. For newsgathering and other 
similar uses, the quality is certainly enough, especially considering that 
typical postproduction will be done digitally, which will not degrade the 
quality any further. Compression is mild enough to keep artifacts away in all 
but problem scenes. The 4:1:1/4:2:0 quantization will be visible if you try 
something like chroma keying, however. As stated before, the picture quality in 
all three formats is identical - the targeted market segments are differentiated 
with the features of the equipment and things like available camera quality.
<P>Recently, DVCPRO has been accepted to be standardized as D-7 by <A 
href="http://www.smpte.org/">SMPTE</A>. Panasonic has also introduced a 4:2:2 
version: DVCPRO-50, which is intended to directly rival <A 
href="http://www.hut.fi/~iisakkil/videoformats.html#digitals">Digital S</A> in 
the professional market. <A name=dvchroma></A>
<H5>Chroma subsampling methods used in the DV variants</H5>Above, both 4:1:1 and 
4:2:0 sampling methods have been mentioned. The former means that both of the 
chroma difference signals (<EM>Cr</EM> and <EM>Cb</EM>) are sampled at one 
quarter of the luminance sampling rate. The latter, on the other hand, uses half 
the luma sample rate for the colour differences, but the two differences are 
only sampled on alternating lines (resembling SECAM). Both give the same total 
data rate, but the 4:2:0 sampling gives a better apparent colour resolution for 
PAL.
<P>In the NTSC world, all three DV variants use 4:1:1 sampling. In the PAL 
versions, DV and DVCAM revert to 4:2:0, whereas DVCPRO uses 4:1:1 globally. 
Here's a catch - if you dub between PAL DVCPRO and one of the other formats, 
you'll end up with the worst from both worlds: a 4:1:0 sampled image, where both 
vertical and horizontal colour resolutions are only half of the conventional 
broadcast quality 4:2:2 sampling.

<H4>Digital8</H4>A recently introduced consumer format from Sony. Digital8 
records for all practical purposes the same signal as DV, but uses cheaper Hi8 
tapes and can play back old analogue 8mm/Hi8 tapes. <A name=dvhs></A>
<H4>D-VHS</H4>New format by JVC. This is a digital "bit bucket" format which is 
intended to store future digital broadcasts directly in its compressed format. 
Particularly, the machines will not have conventional video inputs and outputs 
at all - they work through a set-top decoder, just like direct digital 
broadcasts off the air. The machines will all have IEEE 1394 digital interfaces, 
like some DV format equipment do.
<P>Longest tape should be able to store 44.4 GB of data. Recording times depend 
on the mode used, ranging from 3.5 hours of HDTV to 49 hours of 2 Mbps video in 
LP mode. Standard mode will record seven hours of video at 19.14 Mbps. <A 
name=wvhs></A>
<H4>W-VHS</H4><EM>W-VHS</EM> was introduced by JVC in the 1994 NAB show. It is a 
analogue high definition format using a cassette physically identical with VHS.
<P>Normally records 1125 lines of analog RGB video, but can switch to an NTSC 
mode, in which it can either record twice as much high quality NTSC video, or 
even two different video signals. The latter function is used for field 
sequential 3D video. <A name=digitals></A>
<H4>Digital S</H4><EM>Digital S</EM> is a digital format downward compatible 
with S-VHS. Cassette is basically a W-VHS high coercivity tape in a dust-proof 
version of the VHS cassette case. Digital S rivals the much more expensive 
Digital Betacam in terms of picture quality because of the mild compression and 
4:2:2 quantizing.
<P>JVC's Digital S editing deck sports a rarely seen feature, video pre-read 
head, which allows the old video recording to be played back while recording new 
signal just after that. This makes A/B roll edits possible with just two decks.
<P>JVC also has a <A href="http://www.digital-s.com/">web site</A> dedicated to 
Digital-S. <A name=betacamsx></A>
<H4>Betacam SX</H4>Hot from the ovens at Sony, <EM>Betacam SX</EM> is a digital 
format using a 4:2:2 coded variant of <A 
href="http://www.crs4.it/~luigi/MPEG/mpegfaq.html">MPEG</A>. Like DVCPRO, it's 
capable of accelerated playback/recording and is part of Sony's new all-digital 
production concept, targeted especially for ENG and newsroom use. Some units are 
4:3 / 16:9 switchable.
<P>Despite primarily being a tape format, some decks are actually disk/tape 
hybrids and provide rudimentary stand alone non-linear editing capabilities. 
"Briefcase" field editors resembling laptop computers are available, similar to 
what Panasonic has for its DVCPRO format.
<P>More hype is available on Sony's <A href="http://www.betacamsx.com/">Betacam 
SX</A> site. <A name=hdd1000></A>
<H4>Sony HDD-1000</H4>This is a full bandwidth 1.2 Gbps digital HDTV recorder 
based on 1" open reel C format. Prototyped as early as in 1987, the format 
records 1125 line HDTV at either 59.94 or 60 Hz field rate. The steep price tag 
(~$350000 for the units, and 63 minutes of tape will set you back $1300!) makes 
this format somewhat of a curiosity, but it is both available and in use.
